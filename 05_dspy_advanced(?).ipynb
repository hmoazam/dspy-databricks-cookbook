    "You already know a lot about DSPy at this point. If all you want is quick scripting, you likely now have the skillset to be effective. Sprinkling DSPy signatures and modules into your Python control flow is a pretty ergonomic way to just get stuff done with LMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, you're likely here because you want to build high-quality systems and improve them over time. The way to do that in DSPy is to leverage an evaluation cycle along with DSPy's [Optimizers](https://dspy.ai/learn/optimization/overview/).\n",

    "For our prototype we will use a bunch of StackExchange-based questions and their correct answers from the [RAG-QA Arena](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13998) dataset.  The dataset is prepare and divided into a train, validation, and dev sub-sets in the notebook executed below "
